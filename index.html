            <li><p> <h2>(Background):</h2>: At the age of 15, I was approved at the Naval Highschool and later graduated from the Naval Academy. I participated in military exercises, sports teams, and in various events I had the honor of being the speaker and presenter, such as the Leadership Symposium, for example. After the Naval School, I had the opportunity to travel the world aboard the Brazil School Ship during the 33rd Instruction Trip of the Navy Aspiring Officers in 2019, passing through 14 ports abroad. In the end, I was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to resign and take other professional paths.
